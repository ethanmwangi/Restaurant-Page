    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Nestled in the heart of the city, Lotus Ramen Shop has been a beloved culinary destination since its inception in
      2020. Inspired by the rich traditions of Japanese ramen-making, our founder, Hiroshi Tanaka, embarked on a journey
      to bring authentic flavors to our community.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Hiroshi's passion for ramen began in his grandmother's kitchen in Kyoto, where he learned the art of crafting the
      perfect broth and hand-pulling noodles. After years of perfecting his craft, he opened Lotus Ramen, named after
      the lotus flower, symbolizing purity and resilience.
